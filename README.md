# Drug-Redirection
Drug Redirection Based on Knowledge Graph and Graph Neural Network (GNN)


• Used the deep learning framework DGL, which made the codes run more efficiently and adopted the basic model of Geom-GCN

• Selected the data from DrugBANK and adopted the TransE_L2 node embedding method with the purpose of verifying the use of knowledge graph embedding technology to generate meaningful entity and relationship embedding, that is, edge prediction

• Divided the edge triples into three parts in the proportions of 90%, 5% and 5% as the training, verification and test set, concluded that  embedding method of TransE can better predict the potential relationship between drugs and diseases
